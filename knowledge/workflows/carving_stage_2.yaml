title: "Stage 2 – Internal Hollow Routing & Structural Bridges (Controlled Aggressive Removal)"
tree_type: conifer
applicable_species:
  - juniper
  - cypress
  - thuja

position_in_workflow:
  after: carving_stage_1_5
  before: carving_stage_3

purpose:
  - connect entry holes into a single internal cavity system
  - remove bulk internally to reduce visual mass while preserving outer silhouette
  - define structural bridges and uneven wall thickness
  - set irreversible carving limits before refinement shaping

stage_2_core_method:
  step_sequence:
    - step: "2.1 – Re-mark STOP boundaries"
      goal: "refresh Stage 1.5 boundaries before material removal"
      tools:
        - pencil
        - chalk
        - masking_tape
      checks:
        - "STOP boundary visible from 2 angles"
        - "live vein zone marked and untouched"
      duration_minutes: 10-15

    - step: "2.2 – Connect entry holes (routing path)"
      goal: "link drilled holes into a continuous internal cavity"
      tools:
        - flame_carbide_burr
        - tapered_carbide_burr
      technique:
        - "short passes, connect holes gradually"
        - "avoid straight-line routing; create wandering organic path"
      stop_signs:
        - "approaching STOP line"
        - "inner wall becomes thin"
      duration_minutes: 15-25

    - step: "2.3 – Bulk removal (internal only)"
      goal: "remove mass from the inside while preserving external silhouette"
      tools:
        - large_cylindrical_carbide_burr
        - long_shank_ball_carbide_burr
      technique:
        - "hollow follows trunk movement; never a straight tube"
        - "leave ribs/bridges every 3–6 cm (visual guideline) where structure needs strength"
        - "uneven wall thickness: thick near live vein, variable elsewhere"
      stop_signs:
        - "wood flex"
        - "hot spot / burning smell"
        - "approaching live vein zone"
      duration_minutes: 20-30

    - step: "2.4 – Bridge & wall logic check (pause checkpoint)"
      goal: "ensure structural stability and final-limit definition"
      tools:
        - flashlight
        - pencil
      checks:
        - "at least 2 structural bridges remain"
        - "no thinning near live vein"
        - "walls remain thick + irregular"
        - "outer silhouette unchanged"
      decision:
        continue_if_all_checks_pass: true
        stop_and_rest_if_any_check_fails: true
      duration_minutes: 5-10

deliverable_of_stage_2:
  what_success_looks_like:
    - "connected internal cavity (not decorative)"
    - "outer trunk silhouette unchanged"
    - "internal flow follows trunk movement"
    - "walls thick and irregular; asymmetry present"
    - "clear STOP boundaries respected everywhere"
  what_failure_looks_like:
    - "straight tunnels"
    - "thin walls near live vein"
    - "outer silhouette altered"
    - "symmetry or 'manufactured' look"

  note: "Stage 2 defines irreversible limits. If unsure, stop early and reassess."

  match_reference_language:
    key_phrases:
      - "work from inside outward"
      - "STOP boundaries"
      - "keep walls thick and irregular"
      - "do NOT widen hollow toward live vein"
      - "do NOT create straight tunnels"
