title: "Stage 4 – Controlled Execution & Carving Strategy"

position_in_workflow:
  after: carving_stage_3
  before: carving_stage_5

role:
  translate narrative and structural logic into physical carving actions
  without introducing new design decisions

core_principle:
  execution must obey narrative, not improve it

execution_order:
  - stabilize tree and confirm planting angle
  - mark no-touch zones physically (chalk or pencil)
  - rough carving only in pre-approved deadwood zones
  - pause before any transition area between live and dead tissue

carving_depth_control:
  max_material_removal_per_session: "minimal to moderate"
  guideline: "always leave more than you think you need"
  irreversible_cut_policy: "one per session maximum"

tool_usage_logic:
  allowed:
    - carbide_burr_small
    - hand_gouge
    - wire_brush_soft
  restricted:
    - power_tools_high_rpm
    - sanding_drums
  forbidden:
    - chainsaw
    - aggressive hollowing

decision_checkpoints:
  before_deepening_hollows:
    question: "Does this deepen the story or just add drama?"
  before_removing_structural_bridge:
    question: "Is this bridge part of the survival logic?"
  before_smoothing:
    question: "Is refinement appropriate at this stage?"

stop_conditions:
  - live_vein_thickness_feels_compromised
  - loss_of_directional_flow
  - fatigue_or_rush_detected

output_of_stage:
  - clearly readable deadwood narrative
  - intact live vein hierarchy
  - unfinished texture accepted and preserved

handoff_to_next_stage:
  focus: refinement, aging, and visual continuity
  condition: only after rest period and reassessment
