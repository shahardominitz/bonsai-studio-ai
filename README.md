# BonsAI Studio

BonsAI Studio is a decision-support system for producing
photorealistic, botanically honest bonsai visualizations
from real pre-bonsai reference images.

This project does NOT generate fantasy bonsai.
It reveals the highest realistic potential already latent
in the existing material.

## Core Principles
- No invention. Only transformation.
- Every visible feature must be traceable to the reference image.
- Beauty never overrides botanical honesty.

## System Structure
- governance/ – binding macro rules (non-negotiable)
- prompts/ – proven, production-ready prompts per engine
- workflows/ – carving & design logic stages
- tests/ – experimental or validation runs

## Engines
Primary visualization engine:
- Nano Banana Pro

Prompt analysis & refinement:
- GenSpark (non-visual, reasoning only)

## IMPORTANT
All prompts MUST comply with:
`knowledge/governance/bonsai_studio_prompt_spec.yaml`
