title: "Stage 5 - Final Evaluation, Aftercare & Long Recovery"

position_in_workflow:
  after: carving_stage_4
  before: carving_stage_6

role:
  - freeze final carving outcome (no new design decisions)
  - verify structural + biological safety
  - run recovery protocol and document baseline for future refinement

core_rule:
  - no_more_carving: "STOP all carving immediately after Stage 5 sign-off"
  - no_new_features: "do not add new hollows, new openings, new shari paths, or new jin concepts"

success_criteria:
  must_pass:
    - live_vein_intact: true
    - branches_unchanged: "no branch removal or repositioning in this stage"
    - hollow_reads_as_natural_decay: true
    - no_artificial_symmetry: true
    - outer_silhouette_not_damaged: true
    - transitions_respect_live_dead_boundary: true
  desired:
    - wall_thickness_irregular: true
    - internal_bridges_preserved: true
    - grain_followed: true

evaluation_checklist:
  visual_checks:
    - "Step back 2–3 meters: does the hollow follow trunk movement (not straight tunnels)?"
    - "Check from 3 angles: are openings believable and not evenly spaced?"
    - "Confirm shari/jin flow aligns with trunk narrative from Stage 4"
    - "Confirm outer silhouette was not thinned or flattened by accident"
  tactile_checks:
    - "Finger test: edges are softened (no razor edges that look 'carved')"
    - "Probe gently: no thin 'paper walls' that feel fragile"
  live_tissue_warning_signs:
    stop_if_any:
      - "moist, bright-green cambium appears where it shouldn't"
      - "sap bleed / wet tissue"
      - "fresh tearing at live/dead boundary"
      - "cracking sound from structural bridges"

tools_allowed:
  - nylon_brush_soft
  - hand_brush
  - compressed_air_or_pump_blower
  - tweezers
  - soft_paintbrush
  - isopropyl_wipe_for_tools_only

tools_forbidden:
  - dremel
  - carbide_burr_any
  - sanding_drum
  - flame_burr
  - drill_bits
  - aggressive_gouges
  - wire_brush_hard
  - torch

cleaning_protocol:
  goal: "remove dust, reveal true contours, avoid polishing"
  steps:
    - "Dry brush and blow out all cavities (inside-first)."
    - "Use soft brush to clear pockets; avoid scrubbing live vein."
    - "Do NOT use water jet or pressure wash."
    - "Do NOT over-brush until wood becomes shiny."

deadwood_protection:
  timing: "apply only after the surface is fully dry and the tree is stable"
  allowed_options:
    - option_a: "lime sulfur (traditional deadwood preservative) - light application"
    - option_b: "specialized deadwood hardener (if wood is soft/crumbly)"
  rules:
    - "Never apply preservative onto live vein or buds."
    - "If uncertain where live tissue is: do NOT apply; postpone."
    - "Keep appearance matte and natural—avoid glossy coatings."

recovery_plan:
  stage_name: "Recovery Phase (No carving for months)"
  minimum_no_carving_period_months: 3
  immediate_48h:
    - "Place in bright shade / no harsh midday sun."
    - "Protect from strong wind (reduces desiccation)."
    - "Normal watering routine; do not overwater as a reaction."
  weeks_1_4:
    - "No wiring, no repotting, no heavy pruning."
    - "Monitor leaf turgor and new growth; log weekly photos."
    - "If heat wave: increase shade + humidity management."
  weeks_4_12:
    - "If vigorous growth returns, begin only light maintenance pruning."
    - "Still no carving. Focus on health + stabilization."

documentation_required:
  photo_set:
    - "Front (chosen design angle)"
    - "Left 45°"
    - "Right 45°"
    - "Back"
    - "Top-down"
    - "Close-up: all openings"
    - "Close-up: live/dead boundary zones"
  notes_template:
    - "Date"
    - "What was changed in Stage 4 (summary)"
    - "What was explicitly NOT changed"
    - "Any risk zones observed"
    - "Recovery conditions (sun/wind/water)"
    - "Next review date"

sign_off_gate:
  pass_conditions:
    - "All must_pass success_criteria are true"
    - "No live_tissue_warning_signs triggered"
    - "Full documentation captured"
  if_fail:
    - "Stop, do not 'fix' with more carving. Move to recovery and reassess after 2–4 weeks."

next_stage_hint:
  stage_6_goal: "Long-term refinement planning (future seasons), not execution"
  note: "Stage 6 exists to plan future micro-refinement only after strong recovery, never immediately."
