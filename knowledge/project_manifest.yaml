  language_primary: "he"
  audience:
    - bonsai_hobbyists
    - advanced_practitioners
    - workshop_instructors
  product_goal:
    - "Centralize bonsai design knowledge + prompt evolution"
    - "Generate photorealistic visualization prompts (Nano-Banana / Nano-Banana Pro)"
    - "Convert visualizations into real-world work plans (stages, tools, safety, timing)"
    - "Evolve into an accessible agent/app for bonsai worldwide"

  pillars:
    P1_photoreal_fidelity:
      description: "Outputs must be unmistakably reality-bound and botanically plausible."
      non_negotiables:
        - "No invented branches, trunks, foliage, or deadwood not present in references."
        - "If a single reference image is declared, it is the only source of truth."
        - "Allowed change: viewpoint/pot tilt ONLY to enhance readability, not to invent structure."

    P2_stage_discipline:
      description: "No skipping intermediate stages. Risk is controlled by resolution (Stage 1 → 1.5 → 2)."
      timeboxing:
        carving_sessions: "20–40 minutes max"
        rest_intervals_days: "7–14 days between heavy carving sessions"
      hard_stops:
        - "Stop if moist/live tissue appears unexpectedly."
        - "Stop if approaching live vein boundaries."
        - "Do not touch outer silhouette when the plan is internal hollowing."

    P3_conifer_deadwood_language:
      description: "Jin & Shari are structural storytelling, not decoration."
      rules:
        jin:
          - "Jin only from existing dead tips/sections."
          - "Irregular fibers, follow grain, avoid symmetry."
        shari:
          - "Follow trunk movement and grain."
          - "Never widen toward live veins."
          - "Avoid straight tunnels and mirrored patterns."

        - "Stage + Version label"
        - "Constraints: DO / DO NOT"

      infographic_contract:
        must_include:
          - "Tool heads per step"
          - "Forbidden zones / STOP boundaries"
          - "Session duration + mandatory rest interval"
          - "Warnings + what NOT to touch"

  immediate_next_steps:
    - step: 1
      action: "Create or confirm knowledge/bonsai_core.yaml as source-of-truth rules"
    - step: 2
      action: "Add agents/bonsai_studio_agent.yaml (orchestration agent spec)"
    - step: 3
      action: "Add first prompt pack: conifer jin/shari photoreal v1 (strict)"
    - step: 4
      action: "Connect repo to GenSpark AI Developer (Existing GitHub Project)"
    - step: 5
      action: "Iterate: stage packs + infographic continuity + user flows"

  success_criteria:
    MVP:
      - "Given 1 reference image, output photoreal prompt with zero invented elements"
      - "Given carving reference infographic, generate missing stage panels consistently"
      - "Produce a staged work plan with rest intervals and tool heads"
    product:
      - "Agent that guides users from photos → design → safe plan → visuals"
      - "Multi-language support (EN/HE) for global community"

  notes:
    - "This repo is the canonical core. A separate repo may later host the web/app UI."
    - "Do not rename repo during core formation; preserve history and continuity."
