Prompt Name: OLIVE CARVING — Stage 3: Secondary Shaping & Flow Definition
Version: 3.0
File: knowledge/workflows/carving_stage_3.yaml
id: carving_stage_3
version: "3.0"
title: "Stage 3 — Secondary Shaping & Flow Definition"
tree_type: broadleaf
applicable_species:
  - olive

position_in_workflow:
  after: carving_stage_2
  before: carving_stage_5

stage_goal:
  - translate internal boundary limits into a readable exterior flow
  - refine the hollow into a natural, asymmetrical decay narrative
  - preserve structural bridges and uneven wall thickness
  - prepare surfaces for later aging/finishing (NOT final polish)

session_plan:
  intensity: light_to_medium
  sessions:
    - session_length_minutes: 20-30
      max_sessions_in_stage: 2
      mandatory_rest_days_after_each_session: "10-14"
  stop_conditions:
    - "If moist/live tissue appears anywhere in the hollow"
    - "If outer silhouette begins to thin or flatten"
    - "If the wall thickness becomes uniform or symmetric"
    - "If tool heat builds up (wood feels hot to touch)"

tools_primary:
  - tool: dremel_or_rotary_tool
    speed_guideline_rpm: "low-medium (avoid heat buildup)"
    notes:
      - "Use short passes, frequent pauses"
      - "Brush away dust often to read grain and depth"

bits_and_attachments:
  shaping_bits:
    - bit: carbide_burr_ball
      use_for:
        - "softly rounding transitions inside the hollow"
        - "breaking straight lines into organic undulations"
      avoid:
        - "do not use near live vein edges"
        - "do not create symmetric scoops"
    - bit: carbide_burr_taper
      use_for:
        - "defining flow direction and narrowing channels"
        - "creating irregular 'tear' edges and depth variation"
      avoid:
        - "do not drill straight tunnels"
        - "do not chase depth toward live vein"
    - bit: carbide_burr_flame_or_egg
      use_for:
        - "sculpting natural-looking folds and inner ridges"
        - "introducing 'age waves' that follow trunk movement"
      avoid:
        - "do not smooth everything (keep texture)"
        - "do not touch branch collars/bases"
  finishing_pre_bits_not_final:
    - bit: nylon_brush_attachment
      use_for:
        - "cleaning the hollow to reveal grain"
        - "softly blending tool marks without polishing"
      avoid:
        - "do not erase all texture"
    - bit: fine_sanding_drum_optional
      grit: "180-240"
      use_for:
        - "only to soften sharp, unnatural edges"
        - "only on deadwood (never on live tissue)"
      avoid:
        - "no broad sanding; no uniform surfaces"
        - "no smoothing the 'story' out of the wood"

protected_zones_do_not_touch:
  - "outer trunk silhouette (keep original outline)"
  - "live vein corridor (buffer zone along suspected sap path)"
  - "branch bases / collars / swelling at attachment points"
  - "structural bridges (internal ribs holding strength)"
  - "any area that shows moisture, green cambium, or flexible tissue"

rules_of_form:
  - "Work from inside outward — do not thin exterior walls to achieve depth"
  - "Hollow must follow trunk movement (flow), never straight vertical tunnels"
  - "Maintain uneven wall thickness: thick + irregular reads natural"
  - "Avoid symmetry: no mirrored openings, no repeated shapes"
  - "Leave 'islands' and ribs: natural decay leaves structure behind"

deliverables_end_of_stage:
  - "Clear readable flow line through the hollow (visual path)"
  - "No straight tunnels; no widened area toward live vein"
  - "Outer silhouette unchanged"
  - "Texture reads as natural decay (not decorative carving)"
  - "Photos taken from same angle for tracking before next stage"

documentation_required:
  photos:
    - "Front chosen design angle (same distance/height each time)"
    - "45-degree left"
    - "45-degree right"
    - "Top-down into hollow"
  notes:
    - "What changed (exact areas)"
    - "Which bit used and why"
    - "Any moisture/heat events (if yes, stop and extend rest)"

handoff_to_stage_5:
  prerequisite_checklist:
    - "Live vein intact"
    - "Branch bases untouched"
    - "Hollow depth and borders consistent with Stage 2 limits"
    - "Walls thick and irregular"
    - "Tree shows no stress signs after rest window"
